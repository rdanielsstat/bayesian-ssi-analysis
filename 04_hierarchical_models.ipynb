    "The random-intercepts generalized linear mixed model yields results that are broadly consistent with those from the standard [logistic regression](#lr_fit) and [Bayesian binomial](#nh_fit) models. Facilities classified as community hospitals with more than 250 beds and major teaching hospitals exhibit significantly higher odds of surgical site infection relative to the reference group, while the effect for community hospitals with 125 to 250 beds is positive but not statistically significant.\n",

    "The estimated county-level random intercept variance is 0.178, corresponding to a standard deviation of 0.422 on the log-odds scale, indicating meaningful heterogeneity in baseline infection risk across counties. This suggests that unobserved county-level factors contribute to variation in infection rates beyond what is explained by facility type alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing AIC values with the [logistic model](#lr_fit) provides a rough measure of relative model fit. Although the models differ in structure and are estimated using different likelihood formulations, the large difference observed here, 978 for the facility-type-only logistic regression versus 943 for the GLMM, indicates that the model including a county-level random intercept fits the data substantially better."
