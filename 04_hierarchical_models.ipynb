Although the models differ in structure and are estimated using different likelihood formulations, the large difference observed here, 978 for the facility-type-only logistic regression versus 943 for the GLMM, indicates that the model including a county-level random intercept fits the data substantially better."

Formally, for a simplified normal approximation, the BLUP can be expressed as:\n",
