Each BLUP is a weighted combination of the observed county mean and the overall mean, implementing partial pooling: counties with few facilities are shrunk strongly toward the global mean, while counties with many facilities rely more on their own data. Formally, for a simplified normal approximation, the BLUP can be expressed as:\n",

    "- $\\sigma^2_\\text{resid}$ is the residual variance at the facility level\n",

    "The hierarchical Bayesian model provides partially pooled estimates of SSI risk for each facility while accounting for county-level variation. The posterior means indicate that all three non-reference facility types have higher log-odds of infection than the reference group, with 95% credible intervals largely above zero. The county-level standard deviation, σ ≈ 0.46, reflects moderate variation in baseline risk across counties. Compared with simpler models, the hierarchical approach stabilizes estimates for smaller facilities and better captures multilevel structure, offering a principled framework for facility-level risk estimation.\n",

    "These results provide an initial view of facility- and county-level effects; a more formal comparison across models, along with further diagnostics and residual analysis, can be conducted in a future review. For now, this establishes a foundation for interpreting partial pooling and posterior uncertainty in SSI risk estimates."
